Peer Review & Learning Strategies
(Portfolio Section – English)
1. Peer Review: Definition & Purpose
Peer Review is a structured process in which individuals at a similar competence level evaluate each other’s work critically and constructively.
Its purpose is to:
• 	improve the quality of work
• 	identify blind spots
• 	introduce alternative perspectives
• 	deepen learning
• 	strengthen reflection and accountability
Peer Review is not supervision — it is collaborative quality development.

2. Characteristics of Effective Peer Review
A) Objectivity
Focus on clarity, logic, structure, and evidence — not personal preferences.
B) Constructiveness
Feedback is solution‑oriented, specific, and respectful.
C) Transparency
Criteria are clearly defined (e.g., coherence, completeness, accuracy).
D) Reciprocity
Peer Review is mutual:
Those who give feedback also receive feedback.
E) Reflection
The receiver actively evaluates which suggestions to adopt and why.

3. Common Peer Review Methods
• 	Feedback Sandwich (positive – critical – positive)
• 	WWW/EBI (“What Went Well / Even Better If…”)
• 	Guided Review with predefined criteria
• 	Critical Friend Approach (honest, direct, trust‑based)
• 	Collaborative Review (joint revision in real time)

📘 4. Learning Strategies: Overview & Benefits
Learning strategies are deliberate methods used to acquire, process, and retain knowledge more effectively.
They fall into three main categories:

A) Cognitive Learning Strategies
Support understanding and processing of information.
• 	summarising
• 	visualising (mind maps, diagrams)
• 	elaboration (connecting ideas, generating examples)
• 	repetition & practice
• 	self‑testing

B) Metacognitive Learning Strategies
Regulate and monitor the learning process.
• 	setting learning goals
• 	monitoring progress
• 	adjusting strategies
• 	self‑reflection
• 	time management

C) Resource‑Based Learning Strategies
Optimise the learning environment and available tools.
• 	choosing an effective study environment
• 	managing breaks and energy
• 	using digital tools
• 	collaborating with others
• 	organising materials

📘 5. How Peer Review Supports Learning
Peer Review itself is a high‑impact learning strategy because it:
• 	requires active processing of knowledge
• 	encourages perspective‑taking
• 	strengthens critical thinking
• 	raises personal quality standards
• 	embeds learning in a social context
Those who give high‑quality feedback often learn the most.

📘 6. Application in My Portfolio
I use Peer Review and learning strategies to:
• 	critically evaluate AI‑generated content
• 	identify errors, inconsistencies, and hallucinations
• 	reflect on why a model fails or succeeds
• 	improve my own prompting techniques
• 	structure complex topics (e.g., politics, healthcare systems) clearly and logically
This demonstrates my ability to work analytically, reflectively, and with a strong focus on quality — key competencies in modern AI‑supported environments.
