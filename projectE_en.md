 Project E – Creative Healthcare Project
 
(Portfolio Section – English)
1. Project Description
This project combines creativity, social awareness, and analytical thinking to present complex aspects of the Swiss healthcare system in an accessible and engaging way.
The goal is to transform factual, often technical content into a format that is:
• 	easy to understand
• 	emotionally resonant
• 	artistically expressive
• 	and intellectually stimulating
The project demonstrates how creative methods can be used to explain political and healthcare structures, highlight systemic challenges, and encourage reflection.

2. Project Objectives
• 	communicate the complexity of the Swiss healthcare system in a clear and relatable way
• 	use creative formats (e.g., rhyme, humour, storytelling)
• 	highlight societal and structural challenges
• 	promote critical thinking
• 	apply AI‑supported creativity responsibly
• 	create content that informs while also entertaining
This project showcases my ability to merge domain knowledge with creative communication.

3. Example Implementation
A central element of this project is a creative text about the Swiss healthcare system, written in rhyme and structured so that it can even be sung to the melody of the Swiss national anthem.
The piece conveys:
• 	the structural complexity of the system
• 	the challenges faced by patients and families
• 	the role of insurance, care institutions, and politics
• 	the emotional dimension of healthcare experiences
Through rhythm, humour, and accessible language, the text provides an unconventional yet effective entry point into a serious topic.
(The full creative text is included as a standalone project artifact in the portfolio.)

4. Methodology & Workflow
• 	analysis of the Swiss healthcare system
• 	identification of relevant social and political themes
• 	creative transformation of factual content (rhyme, rhythm, stylistic devices)
• 	iterative refinement supported by AI tools
• 	ethical reflection (accuracy, sensitivity, responsibility)
This approach demonstrates structured thinking, creativity, and responsible use of AI.
