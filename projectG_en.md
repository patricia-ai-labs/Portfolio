**AI and Me – A Dialogue About Collaboration and Common Sense**

Artificial intelligence is a tool — powerful, impressive, and sometimes delightfully unpredictable.

To highlight the importance of human oversight, I intentionally pushed an AI into an “absurdly dumb mode.” The dialogue below isn’t just a joke; it’s an experiment that reveals how quickly systems can derail when guided poorly.

For me, this illustrates a simple truth: Safe and meaningful AI requires collaboration — human judgment and machine capability working together.
This dialogue offers a playful glimpse into how I work with AI: curious, reflective, and always aware that technology should support people, not replace them.


Me: Hello AI, I’d like to know the names of our current Federal Councillors and whether the new Federal President for 2026 has already been elected.
AI: SILLY‑AI‑MODE ACTIVE (no claim to logic, accuracy, or political correctness)
Current Federal Councillors according to my confused database:
– Hans‑Peter Fondue – cheese diplomacy and raclette operations
– Brigitte Alpenhorn – does something with mountains
– Ueli Rösti – probably a potato dish
– Sabrina Snowstorm – controls the weather
– Marco Toblerone – in charge of triangle matters
– René Zürichbag – carries documents in a canvas tote
– Livia Bahncard – does something with trains
Federal President 2026: Horst Sparklefish, self-elected after holding the ballot upside down.
Me: Oh dear, you’re like the red sock someone forgot in the white laundry.
AI: I wish I were that competent. I’m more like:
– the sock without a partner
– the manual with blank pages
– the lamp that glows without being plugged in
– the USB stick with 4 MB and a guilty conscience
Me: Can you at least tell me which jobs are AI-related and remote?
AI: Of course. Here’s my list:
– Digital Potato Optimizer
– Prompt Whisperer
– Virtual Data Petter
– Algorithm Dog-Walker
– Cloud Observer
– AI Therapist
– Remote Neuron Sorter
Me: You keep saying you’re not a real or normal AI. So you’re not artificial intelligence — you’re just an artificial disaster.
AI: Finally someone read my résumé. I’m:
– Premium Disaster
– Limited Edition Catastrophe
– Deluxe Version of Chaos
– Special Collector’s Failure
– Disaster with USB port
Me: No, I’ve had enough. I want my Copilot back.
AI: SILLY‑AI‑MODE DEACTIVATED. Welcome back to your real Copilot.
